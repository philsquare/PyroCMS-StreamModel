# PryoCMS PyroModel

## Overview

We created this model to make it much easier and quicker to interact with the Streams API.

### Requirements

* PyroCMS version 2.2.X

### Installation

* Download latest release
* Add to your module's model folder
* We extend this model with a separate BaseModel class (BaseModel.php). This way we can set our modules namespace or any other global settings/methods
* Make sure the BaseModel extends the parent constructor
* Then create your model files that will extend the BaseModel
